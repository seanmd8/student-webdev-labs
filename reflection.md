## Reflection Document

### HTML

Enter your reflections on this section here.

### Lab 01-html
- I was able to complete the excercises here on my own.
- I found the table excercise to be the most helpful since it helped me understand the syntax behind stuff like colspan and rowspan as well as the structure of tables.
- I think these ones were all explained pretty well.
- The excercises did a good job of covering a wide range of basic HTML stuff so they felt pretty complete.

### Lab 02-a11y
- This one wasn't assigned, right?

### Lab 03-css
- I did manage to complete these on my own.
- The position and media queries excercises focused on concepts it was super useful to know. I actually found the HW 2 selectors game to be super helpful for completing this one.
- I could maybe have used a bit more on positioning, but I think the excercise helped me get used to it a lot more.
- Maybe a bit more explanation on whether it's better practice to give every '<p>' in a div a class versus giving the div a class and styling them via '.div-class p' rather than '.p-class'.

### Lab 04-flexbox
- I did manage to do this one myself, though I looked at the example code linked at the end of the slides.
- This section was pretty good. I think the variety was the most helpful rather than any individual excercise.
- I think it was explained fine, but I always found myself mixing up 'justify-content' and 'align-content'.
- We never got practice with the order property so that could have been useful.

### Lab 05-css-grid
- I found this to be super intuitive once I got the hang of it so I did it myself.
- They were both pretty equal in helping me to learn stuff.
- It was a bit unclear what to do in the grid areas section. I ended up copying the grid container to make 3 of them since it gave 3 pictures, but I later realized it might have been wanting the once it gave to be changed depending on screen size?
-Seemed like it gave good coverage.

### Lab 06-bootstrap
- I didn't start this one for a while since the screenshots for what our output should look like had the wrong link (an extra ../) which meant it looked like they were just missing. I kept forgetting to ask about it in class and then only realized the pictures were actually there, just linked wrong, a little before the labs were due. 

### Lab 07-javascript
- I already have experience in JavaScript from before this class, so this one was pretty easy.
- I appreciated the extra practice with the functional methods since I took intro to functional programming last quarter but hadn't used those in JS before.
- I felt that things were explained well enough.
- I can't think of anything in specific I wish was covered more.

### Lab 08-jquery
- I managed to do this one by myself.
- It felt nice to shrink down a lot of the lines of the code. I appreciated that the excercises enumerated which parts we needed to change.
- I could have used a little more on how to convert '.then's with error handling to callbacks that handled the same errors since preserving the error hanf=dling of the ajax excercise was one thing I didn't do.
- Can't think of any other excercises I needed.
